A travel trought a flooded world

-Noah 
Genesis 6
£
Gospel (Greek: Euaggelion; Latin: evangelium) meaning "good news" 
The Gospel of Jesus is that he paid for our sins on the cross so that whoever believes in him has eternal life

john 3:16-21
£
One sin is enought to deserve hell. so how many lies have you told in your life? Have you ever stolen something? Have you ever taken God's name in vain? Have you ever looked at a woman/man with lustfull and lewd intentions? Have you ever hated someone?
£
If we took you who's probably a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, an adulterer by heart and/or a murderer by heart, would you pass God's judgement? 
You wouldn't and thats why you need Jesus who is able to pay and forgive your sins

Matthew 5:21-32
£
If you feel conviction right now, this is the works of the holy spirit who convicts you of your sins, his goal is to make you give your life to Jesus. Do not let him wait not grief him. The way you give your life to Jesus is trought a change of heart and 
a confession.
Ephesians 4:30
£
Repentance (greek: metanoia; hebrew: Teshuvah) means "changing your mind"

you have to change your mind about your sinfull nature, people tend to say it means to confess your sins to God but it actually means to change your mind of your fleshly nature and follow God. 
£
Religion (greek: thréskeia; hebrew: Avodah) a man made belief with rituals.

Religion is man made and not from God, Jesus even himself got mad at the pharisees for making up thier own religion.

Jesus wants a relationship with us.
£
the only pure and good religion there is in God's eyes is visiting the poor and the widows and staying stainless from the worldly things.
- James 1:27

Jesus loves us as a father loves his sons and daughters.
- John 1:12

Creation

Jesus created the earth in 6 days and rested the 7th. he made all creation and called it "good" until he made humans which he called "very good" We are the creation God is the most proud of. 
-Genesis 1
-John 1:1-3
£
God created humans for the SOLE purpose of having a relationship with us and to have us talk to him and him to us, as the greatest commandement says "Love your Kird your God with all your heart, soul, mind and strenght" and "Love your neightbour as yourself".
£
The story of Israel

among the OT(Old Testament) there is the story of Israel who used to be Jacob before wrestling with Jesus. The people of Israel were taken out of egypt and had to live for 40 years in the desert. God himself provided for them all.
£
Rebelion of Israel

Many times does the bible talks about Israel being unfaithfull to God and worshipping idols and statues. Many times in different books like exodus, judges, jeremiah and others, Israel rebelled against God and God had to fix it.
£
throughout the bible we see God punishing the faithless and rewarding the faithfull in him. this stays as true for Israel as for you the reader.

Even John 3:18 tells us that faith in Jesus is the one and only thing that gets you trought the judgement whitout a burn.
£
Wisdom of the Bible.

There are 3 books that give us different views on life situations
1. Proverbs which is the book of wisdom of the bible.
2. Ecclesiastes in which a priest tells us the hopelessness in anything but God
3. Job in which a man looses everything.
£
Those 3 books combined gives us an idea how we are ment to live. With mainly for faith in God trought life, making everything we can for him, but also with wisdom throughout our daily lives, also accepting loses that are heavy, never blaming it on God, instead remaining steadfast in our walk.

Spiritual warfare

Our fight is not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, and against spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.
Ephesians 6:12 
£
We got to take the armor of God to resist satan, by knowing your life belongs to God, by Knowing that God was rightous and truthfull for you, by knowing the Gospel of Jesus, by using God's word (the bible) and by having faith in God against all wickedness
£
The Judgement Day

Described in Daniel 7 and Revelation 20, it describes how the people will suffer who rejected Jesus and who do not even seek God. Theres a book of sins and a book of life, those who are written in the book of life are saved, the others are condemned

Before the judgement day happens, a lot more things have to happen and one of these things is the rapture that is to come. There will also come a tribulation that concerns all the people who rejected Jesus as thier Lord where God send 21 chaotic event to the earth.
£
The Rapture

Those who believe in Jesus will be gone all at once in a blink of an eye, in the bible it is compared as the momment of Noah's flood. The people remaining on earth will suffer God's wrath.

Matthew 24
1 Thessalonians 4
£
Lessons of Jesus to us humans

When Jesus was on earth he gave both worldly and spiritual lessons.

Let us look at some, also lets analyse some parables Jesus said.
£
The Sermon on the mount.

Jesus starts the Sermon on the mount im matthew 5, starting with the lesson: Jesus came to save the poor in spirit and the ones who need help in life, he came to chastise the proud and to help the humble and people who are in need.
£
Jesus said that we are the salt and the light of this world. We are called to bring the Gospel of Jesus to everyone and bring them taste and hope in thier lives, if salt looses its flavor its only used to be thrown in ice, no longer used to make food get its taste.
Matthew 5:14-15 
£
Jesus did not come to destroy the law but to fullfill it, now those who have faith in Jesus are no longer  condemned by the law, they are no longer under the law. Those who reject Jesus will be judged by the law.
Just as Jesus has fullfilled the law, so do you by following him.
£
The 2 greatest commandements:

1. The Lord is one, You shall Love your Lord your God with all your heart, your mind, your soul and your strenght.
2. You shall love your neightbour as yourself.

Matthew 22:37-40 
£
God is Love.

Those 2 greatest commandements are all the law and prophets.

Jesus also explains in matthew 5 to love your ennemies, even goes as far as feed them when theire hungry

1 John 4:7-12
£
About boasting

do not do anything only for the people around you to see. Do the good things to the people in general and God will reward you in heaven, same goes for praying and fasting as it goes for donating.

Please God not men
£
Do not worry

Don't worry about what you will eat tomorow or what you will wear, God will provide for you, you are more important than the birds God feeds himself. 

You can trust on God for everything he does for you.
£
About Judgement

do not judge others on things you do, and certainly do not judge people whitout using the word of God (the bible) everything else would be trying to take out a speck out of someone elses eye while you have a plank in your own eye.
Don't be a hypocrit!
£
Seek God and you will find him

This is described in all 4 gospels
If you truelly seek God with all your heart you will find him, that is a promise from God for all of us, those who don't seek God will NOT find him!
£
Narrow gate

It might only be 2 verses, but those are very important. 

The majority of people will sadly go to hell because they have rejected Jesus.

Only few will go to heaven.
£
False prophets and deceivers

Many will come in the name of a jesus but not the one the bible proclaims, by thier fruits we recognise them, a lot of the bible warns us about these deceivers 

Matthew 7 | 1 John 4
2 Timothy 4
£
False prophets and deceivers

Many will come in the name of a jesus but not the one the bible proclaims, by thier fruits we recognise them, a lot of the bible warns us about these deceivers 

Matthew 7 | 1 John 4
2 Timothy 4
£
Jesus gives a massive warning for all of you, Many who do not know Jesus will come before his throne and will say "did we not prophesy, cast out demons and done many miracles in your name"
But Jesus will say "Depart from me you workers of evil,
I NEVER KNEW YOU!"
£
The foundation of faith

Build your house on sand so that nothing overthrows you, just as a seed should grow on good soil and not on stone, anything grown or built on stone will break, therefore have a solid foundation in the faith in Jesus.
£
Most important

Vanity of vanities, it is all VANITY, you run after money and men/women. But all of these are vanity, one of the biggest lessons is that God is the only one we should all focus on, everything else gets lost and eaten by moss and rats. Focus on God.
£
Forgiveness

If you forgive others for thier tresspasses so will Jesus forgive you before the father

Remember 
we don't fight against flesh and blood but against evil spirits, be it human spirits or demonic ones.
Ephesians 6
£
Help those who are in need.

By just giving a cold glass of water, you have helped even the least of God. God is well pleased with these acts, just as you have fed God at this point as described in matthew 25:35-40. 
£
Parables of Jesus

Parables are stories that hit certain points in life, understanding these stories you can take out very important lessons for life. Jesus made up to 38 parables.
Here we gonna look at some and explain thier meanings.
£
The grafted in branches

We Christians are grafted into the jews,
we are circumsised by the heart not the foreskin. We are like olive tree branches on a pear tree, it does not make us Jews, yet it makes us part of the people of God. 
£
New Wineskins and clothes

You can't put new wine in old wineskins or else they would burst and get destroyed.
We christians are a new creation. We are no longer our old selves, we become new creature by God's spirit. Dogs don't return to thier womit.
£
The lamp on a lampstand.

Nobody puts a lamp under the bed because there would be no light in the room, people put the lamp on a lampstand to enlighten the whole room. So should we not hide the truth of Jesus away from people.
£
The 2 deptors

One deptor owes 500$
the other owes 50$

and once both didn't have enought money they both got forgiven for free, who is then the one who is more thankfull?

the one who got forgiven more! 
£
The Rich fool

A man builds up treasures for himself on earth, but God calls that man a fool, because he has not built up any treasure in heaven. he has not done anything in the glory of God. everything worldly is vanity
£
the watchfull servant

This parable is all about the second coming of Jesus, how you got to be vigilant and steadfast when Jesus comes back. In this parable the servant remained watchfull and vigilant for his master to come back home and thus got rewarded.
£
The barren fig tree

This parable can be compared with you being the fig tree. God gives you some years for you to turn to him.
But even if you reject him, he will give you a second chance, don't test God or else you'd be burned like the fig tree that didn't give any fruits
£
Parable of the sower

This parable if for the people who spread the word of God. Don't get too mad if not all the seeds grow properly, some of these seeds will fall onto stone and grow fast but also die fast, others will fall in thorns and die. Only a few will actually grow. 
£
Parable of the weeds

In the world we live in, many people have been corrupted by evil doctrines and beliefs. Sometimes it is best to let the people grow and see which ones are growing up as weeds and which ones the wheat, the weed is burned and forgotten.
£
The mustard seed

Faith the size of a mustard seed can move mountains in your life. The mustard seed is the smallest seed in the garden but when it grows up, its the biggest tree in the garden. Have the faith of the size of a mustard seed.
£
The parable of treasures and pearls

These 2 parables explain how God wants us all to come to repentance, we are the pearls, the treasure that God wants to get, and he would pay a great price to get you to heaven with himself.
£
The lost sheep

A good shepard would leave the 99 sheeps behind for getting the one sheep that went astray. You are one of those sheeps that need to be found, and God seeks for every single sheep that goes astray. Jesus is the good shepard that does this for us.
£
The good samaritan

A man got robbed in the desert and beaten up, left to die on the floor. A priest passed by and saw him on the ground, but did not help. A levi passed by too and helped this poor man. Some are more God loving than others even tho thier positions are lower.  
£
The wedding feast

If you are invited for a feast and the owner gives you the lowest place, take it, don't exault yourself and you will be rewarded with a highter place. The proud will be humbled and the humbled will be exaulted.
£
The great banquet

God invites everyone to heaven, but only the poor and the maim accept the invite, the rich and the healthy want to do all the earthly things and don't follow God. Therefore the invite expires and the people remain in darkness forever
£
The tower

Who of you would build a tower but not have all the materials necessary to build that tower? People whould mock you for not being able to finish that tower. So is it for Jesus, whoever does not want to give his 100% to God, will not get eternal life.
£
the Lost Coin

If a woman looses 1 of 10 coins, she would turn on all lights and search that coin until she finds it and greatly rejoices over finding it again, so is it for God for every human that finds Jesus. All the angels rejoice for every sinner that repents.
£
the Prodigal Son

A father has 2 sons, one of them wants to enjoy the world and its goods, he goes and enjoys the fleshly things. But comes back to his father after feeling really bad having abandonned him
But his dad accepts him with open arms and forgives him fully.
£
The Unjust Steward

A Steward who has been scamming everyone lost his job due to being deceitfull

He who dishonnest over little is dishonnest over a lot
but he who is trusted over little is also trusted over a lot
£
The Rich Man and Lazarus (2 pages)

A begar named Lazarus had to beg his whole life and live off the scraps of a rich man. One day both died and ended in sheol. The rich man was burning and begged Lazarus for some water since for him it was well.
£
But Lazarus couldn't even hear him. In fear the rich man begged God for getting to live again to warn his familly about sheol. But God did not allow him since his familly has a prophet to follow but rejects him and would also reject him if he came back to warn them. Don't live for yourself.
£
the Workers in the Vineyard.

2 groups of workers have been hired for a farm to work for a day for 1 coin. one group worked in the morning till the evening and the other started the evening, at the end of the day, they all received 1 coin, which is the deal
£
the Persistent Widow

The begging Widow represents us who have the power to beg to God for taking revenge over unbelieving folks, The wromg that godless people do to people of God can be avenged by God. It is us tho who ask God for revenge.
£
the Pharisee and the Tax Collector

The Pharisee prays in a very pridefull way and thanks God that hes not like the tax collector. The tax collector pray's and says hes a sinner. God has more compassion on the tax collector because he has been humble.
£
the Two Sons

Both sons are called to work on a field, one says "i will not go" but then changes his mind and goes, the other says "i will go" but does not go, God has a lot more compassion on the one who does the work and not just says it. Be doers of the word not hearers.
£
the Tenants

God sent many prophets to warn about people of thier actions and the people killed all the prophets, so God sent his only son, which they crucified, the people deserve severe punishement for killing the only son of God.
£
The fig tree

Jesus will come back one day, just as a summer, we will see the signs of his second coming. the fig tree's leaves turn orange/brown when its ripe, also so are the signs of humanity the big sign of the second coming of Jesus
£
the Ten Virgins

10 virgins wait for thier brides to come back home but don't know when. 5 of them go buy lamp oil to be ready when they do return, the other 5 didn't bother, when the men came back home, only 5 were ready, the other 5 were locked out.
£
the Talents

This parable shows us how if we don't even give the word of God around, just be hearers of the word, but not doers, not even a bit, theres no chance of anyone of us going to heaven. Even just using a bank to make a bit of interest is okay.
£
Some of my personnal thoughts on some biblical topics.

Now we look at some really interesting things not everyone is sure with another, many people don't believe the same thing on certain topics.

Let us look at some
£
Satan getting kicked out of heaven.

People say it was at Genesis, but i think it was at the time of Jesus, Hebrews 2:14 tells us that Jesus took the power to kill away from satan, also satan came before the throne of God in Job while revelation tells us he can't. 
£
About romans 9

Most people say it confirms what John Calvin says, but if we analyse this one properly, its aimed at the jews not to be so pridefull that not everyone of them goes to heaven and that its still God's choice. It talks against pride in people.
£
Matthew 16:18

Some denominations say that its Jesus making thier church, but i completely disagree with that. verse 13 says that its on the mountain "Caesarea Philippi" and theres a place called "gates of hell" which Jesus shown dominance over it.
£
Do apocryphas belong in the bible?

Almost all apocryphas are said to be part of the old testament. Therefore we can take the tanakh as a base of the OT. the tanakh has none of these apocrypha books and has been perfected by the jews back 2500 years 
£
how old is the earth?

looking at the genealogy of Jesus which is well described in the bible, we can say the earth is for sure not millions of years old. it is said that its around 6000 years old, which fits with the genealogy of Jesus. 
£
Hidden meaning behind names.

in the genealogy, we take from Adam to Noah the meanings of the names and we can make a sentance which says: "man is apointed mortal sorrow, but the blessed God shall come down teaching. Hid death shall bring the despairing rest."
£
What is church?

comes from the greek (ἐκκλησία ekklésia) meaning assembly
Ultimately, the church is not a building but the people who come togheter for Jesus. If already 2 or more gather in the name of Jesus, he is with us, this is what a church is. Matthew 18:20
£
about John 14:28

People tend to use that verse and say "Jesus cannot be God"
But a few other verses like john 17:5 and Phillipians 2:7 tell us that Jesus left his glory and power behind to become a servant and ultimately die for our sins.
£
About the mark of the beast

many people talk of 666 being the mark of the beast, which is partially true, the mark is either on the arm or the forehead and its either the name of the best or 666 (the number) whitout it you can't buy or sell anymore.
£
Who is the antichrist?

we shouldn't point fingers at people till the things written about him start to happen. In my personnal view, the bible seems to hint to something like an AI and its mark maybe the brainchip? Also we don't know when it will happen. Acts 1:7
£
Deuteronomy 13:15-17

It was not a ruthless act as we seen many times God acting onto the wickedness of man. While it seems ruthless There was no more goodness in man, only wickedness even in the minds of the childrem, and the sin dwelled all amongs the cities God destroyed. 
£
Israel being evil?

we see in the bible spots like 2 samuel 7:24 and numbers 24:9 who tell us that Israel still is the land of God and not to be messed with. Recently Deuteronomy 28:7 came true and Israel just won against 7 fronts, NEVER mess with God's people.
£
Alcohol for christians

While its debated if christians should drink alcohol, it is actually very clear in the bible. Alcohol is completely fine, its just a question of quantity. Yes were allowed to drink alcohol but we should not get drunk and act foolishly with it.
£
Homosexuality in the bible

Homosexuality is condemned by the bible. The bible speaks clearly not to live of the lusts of the flesh. Passages like romans 1:26-27 tell us how those people who commit these shamefull acts are left to thier own lusts.
£
Islam and Christian God are not the same.

Many people say its the same God and claim thei're both abrahamic faiths. The bible and the quran already contradict another removing the possibility, but also God is love in the bible which does not match the quranic god.
£
Is the bible God's word?

Yes for sure it is God's word, looking at 2 timothy 3:16-17 you see how its God breathed and how its also preparing the believer for every single good works in life. All you need are these 66 books.
£
Can God help me with depression?

Yes he can and is also willing to help you but only if you're willing to believe in him and have the faith of a mustard seed. 

Jesus does wonders all the time, this is why people still believe in him, because he's real.
£

   Thank you for
 reading this book

 Make sure to read           the bible

 May Jesus bless you
  and help you see.

All glory to Jesus

Remember, you're paid in full from him.

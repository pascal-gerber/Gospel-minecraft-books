Spiritual battle

As ephesians 6 tells us to wear the whole armor of God to fight against evil spirits, we have to wear the armor of God and to know that our ennemy is not flesh and blood but principalities, powers, and rulers of darkness in the heavenly places
$
Armor of God

1. Helmet of salvation
2. Breastplate of rightousness
3. Belt of truth
4. Shoes of the gospel of peace
5. Shield of faith
6. Sword of the holy spirit (which is the word of God) or the bible.
$
If you wear the whole armor of God and resist the devil, he will flee from you. The whole armor of God symbolises the walk of a believer of Christ in his daily journey.
you resist the ennemy by not giving up Jesus and by using the word to defend him, by knowing youre saved and in peace with God.
$
Skepticism towards Jesus.
skepticism can become problematic, mostly when believing in another faith/religion
Yet we see Jesus in all religions (which he did not make). Example:
Hinduism and Buddhism - A Good teacher
Islam - A prophet
JW and mormonism - A god example for us
$
Nowhere in any other religions do you find Jesus as the one and only God. Jesus as said never made any religion, thus we are not to follow any religion but Jesus alone. religion always says to be a good person, but Jesus said that were all bad and we all fall short before God.
$
Make copies of this book and spread the word, everyone who follows Jesus, make that the world knows who our Lord our God is. Jesus deserves to be praise and hold up right. Pray to him and open your heart, he will open your eyes and he will walk with you trought this life.
Jesus is Lord.
$
If you dont know what to say to God, say this:

Lord my life belongs to you, Come to me and help me out of my iniquities, i have done many wromg things which i repent from, from today on, my life belongs to you, Amen.
$

Believers can feel the holy spirit in many different ways, one common thing he has, is that he brings Peace and Love to our hearts. Some feel him in the back as tingling, others on all the body, you can even feel him in your hands. If you do feel him, Praise the Lord!!
$
Spiritual Gifts.

Now for born again believers, there come spiritual gifts from the holy spirit, they are gifts and they cannot be exercises, those all come from the holy spirit in us, some are mentionned in 1 corinthians 12 and others in romans.

The Gifts of the holy spirit are here to glorify God and to preach the Gospel more efficiently, not for selfish usages, you will not have God by your side if you try to make money off of it, but you will have God by your side if you want to bring others to Christ.
$
Steadfast walk

To you brothers and sisters i write, stay steadfast in the Lord, do not forsake him and preach salvation upon this world as was commanded to us to do. we all have our struggles and yet God said that we will never be good, therefore stay in the Lord.
$
